# Readable

This is the project for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course where we build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server that you'll use to develop and interact with the front end portion of the project.
The API server has been provided by Udacity. The front end has been built by myself.

## Start Developing

To get started developing right away:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, install and start the webpack dev server
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).

## Front End

Information about the front end, including project guidelines can be found in its [README file](frontend/README.md).
